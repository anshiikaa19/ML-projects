# E-Commerce Rating Classifier

A machine learning project to classify product review ratings (1â€“5 stars) using supervised learning techniques. The model predicts the rating based on numerical features like product price, discount, brand, and other item metadata.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict the star rating of a product based on e-commerce data.
- **Type:** Supervised classification
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **ML Techniques:** Label encoding, feature engineering, ensemble modeling, hyperparameter tuning

## ðŸ“Š Features Used

- Product Price  
- Discount Offered  
- Brand Information  
- Category Details  
- Product Metadata (e.g., shipping time, return policy)  

## ðŸš€ Model Pipeline

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Null handling
   - Feature selection
   - Label encoding for categorical variables

2. **Model Building**
   - XGBoost Classifier
   - Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
